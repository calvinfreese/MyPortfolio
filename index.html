                            &emsp;Full Stack Web Developer, cat dad, and video game fanatic. <br><br>
                            &emsp;As a person with an itch for a creative release, I was initially intrigued by Web Development for the design aspect, but as
                            I started to learn it on my own, I was fully captivated by the challenge the coding portion could pose, both in continuing to learn the HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and
                            also in day-to-day use. No two web sites are exactly alike, and being able to create a gorgeously designed site rich with 
                            functional UI that a business or client can be proud of is not only my goal, but also my passion. <br> <br>
                            &emsp;My first brush with coding came when I had to find a new solution for a cluttered website that was on a server scheduled to be decommissioned. As an IT Business Analyst,
                            I posed two solutions. One was a redesigned website that would generate the daily tasks from a database, and the second was a dynamic form on 
                            a sharepoint site that imported the daily tasks via Microsoft Flow. Working on both solutions was, to date, one of the most exciting work projects
                            I had been a part of. <br><br>
                            &emsp;My work on that project, and a few others, opened a door to become the IT Business Analyst for a team that handles access provisioning. After
                            nearly a year in that role, the new knowledge I absorbed, my great sense of customer service from my former years working the front counter at Geek Squad, and my care 
                            for the individuals on my team, I was promoted to be the supervisor for that team. <br><br>
                            &emsp;In my free time, I can be found buried beneath a pile of sci-fi/fantasy novels, jamming on my guitar, exploring the vast world of Hyrule, or amongst the crowd
                            at a local music venue.  </p> <br>
